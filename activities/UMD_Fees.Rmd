Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate percentage change using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.


### Task 1: Load the tidyverse


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```




### Task 2: Load the UMD Fees dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv

```{r}
umd_fees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv")
```

### Task 3: Calculate the percentage change in each category between Fall 2024 and Fall 2021 using `mutate()`

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2024`- `Fall 2021`)/`Fall 2021` * 100)
```

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2025`- `Fall 2024`)/`Fall 2024` * 100)
```

### Task 4: Describe our results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What's the story here?
2021-2025:
The biggest increases in spending were in Student Sustainability with 150% increase and the Shuttle Bus in 39%. Other increases were in Student Union, Student Activities, and Recreation Services with spending increasing across all three by 11-14%. Athletics spending stayed th same. There was the introduction of the Student Counselling Center. 

2024-2025: 
Biggest spending was a 14% increase in Student Activities. Second was the Shuttle Bus with 9% increase.Student Counselling, Center Recreation Services, Student Union all increased by 3-4.2%. Athletics and Student Sustainability did not change. Total spending went up by 4.5%.

```{r}
comp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/class_composition.csv")

comp |>
  summarize(
    mean_first = mean(first_year),
    mean_soph = mean(sophomore),
    mean_junior = mean(junior),
    mean_senior = mean(senior),
    mean_grad = mean(grad)
  )
```





When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
